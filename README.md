Dribbble Clone

A simple clone of the Dribbble website built using only HTML and CSS. This project replicates the design of the Dribbble homepage, focusing on visual layout, typography, and structure.

Project Status

Current Status: The project is fully functional but not yet responsive. It works well on desktop screens but requires improvements for mobile and tablet devices.

Future Plans: I plan to make the design fully responsive after learning and applying proper responsive web design techniques.
